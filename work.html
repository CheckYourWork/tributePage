   <p align="center"><b>The Lunchbox (2013)</b>: If you are in the mood for a delectable romance, then watch Irrfan Khan’s ‘The Lunchbox’, also starring Nimrat Kaur. He played Saajan Fernandez, an unassuming widower and accountant on the brink of retirement. The story of Ila who mistakenly sends her home-cooked food in a tiffin box to Saajan and how a bond blossoms between the two forms the crux of the movie. Khan, through his brilliant acting, proved that it’s never too late in love or life. While the open ending is frustrating in this romance, it is a movie spearheaded by Khan that simmers with simple desires and the need for companionship. Khan made it work with his impeccable acting as the slightly boring Saajan who was essentially lonely in a crowded city. It’s also one of the romances that proved that you don’t need to have racy scenes between its lead star to make a romance tick.</p>

   <p align="center"><b>Piku (2015)</b>: Director Shoojit Sircar, who broke the news of Khan’s cancer and his death in Mumbai today, gave Khan one of his best films of his career. In ‘Piku’, he was the impish driver company owner who takes the angst-ridden, ageing grandfather played by Amitabh Bachchan and his daughter Piku, played by Deepika Padukone, on a road trip to Kolkata. His playful exchanges with Piku is acting gold. If you are looking for actors whose eyes and expression can speak a thousand dialogues, then Khan is your man. He is one of the few actors who grow on you with each film.</p>

   <p align="center"><b>Hindi Medium (2017)</b> and <b>‘Angrezi Medium’</b> (2020): If a hapless Indian parent who would kill for their child needed a face, then check out Khan’s comedies ‘Hindi Medium’ and his recent ‘Angrezi Medium’, which released in March 2020. These series talk about the education system in India and was a powerful commentary on how far parents go in fulfilling the dreams of their children. The scenes in which Khan tries to admit his child to an elite English school in the city spoke to millions of parents who want their kids to go to the best schools in the city. He also took a swipe at parents who consider certain elite schools as a status symbol in society. These films make you laugh at yourselves as parents.</p>
